WRITE LIKE A NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKER
Reading and writing go hand in hand. Expose yourself to a wide range of texts and topics: read manuals, advertisements, magazines, news articles, essays and reports about culture, science, or anything under the sun! Test your English vocabulary by writing sentences using the new words you’ve encountered. Once you’re comfortable in writing complete sentences, you can practise writing paragraphs and organising them properly.
